# Authentication
The node-sdk-core project supports the following types of authentication:
- Basic Authentication
- Bearer Token Authentication
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) Authentication (grant type: apikey)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) Authentication (grant type: assume)
- Container Authentication
- VPC Instance Authentication
- Cloud Pak for Data Authentication
- Multi-Cloud Saas Platform (MCSP) V1 Authentication
- Multi-Cloud Saas Platform (MCSP) V2 Authentication
- No Authentication (for testing)

The SDK user configures the appropriate type of authentication for use with service instances.
The authentication types that are appropriate for a particular service may vary from service to service,
so it is important for the SDK user to consult with the appropriate service documentation to understand
which authentication types are supported for that service.

The node-sdk-core allows an authenticator to be specified in one of two ways:
1. programmatically - the SDK user invokes the appropriate function(s) to create an instance of the
desired authenticator and then passes the authenticator instance when constructing an instance of the service client.
2. configuration - the SDK user provides external configuration information (in the form of environment variables
or a credentials file) to indicate the type of authenticator, along with the configuration of the necessary properties
for that authenticator. The SDK user then invokes the configuration-based authenticator factory to construct an instance
of the authenticator that is described in the external configuration information.

The sections below will provide detailed information for each authenticator
which will include the following:
- A description of the authenticator
- The properties associated with the authenticator
- An example of how to construct the authenticator programmatically
- An example of how to configure the authenticator through the use of external
configuration information. The configuration examples below will use
environment variables, although the same properties could be specified in a
credentials file instead.


## Basic Authentication
The `BasicAuthenticator` is used to add Basic Authentication information to
each outbound request in the `Authorization` header in the form:

```
   Authorization: Basic <encoded username and password>
```

### Properties

- username: (required) the basic auth username

- password: (required) the basic auth password

### Programming example
```js
const { BasicAuthenticator } = require('ibm-cloud-sdk-core');
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const authenticator = new BasicAuthenticator({
  username: 'myuser',
  password: 'mypassword',
});

const options = {
  authenticator,
};

const service = new ExampleServiceV1(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```

### Configuration example
External configuration:
```
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_AUTH_TYPE=basic
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_USERNAME=myuser
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_PASSWORD=mypassword
```
Application code:
```js
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const options = {
  serviceName: 'example_service',
};

const service = ExampleServiceV1.newInstance(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```


## Bearer Token Authentication
The `BearerTokenAuthenticator` will add a user-supplied bearer token to
each outbound request in the `Authorization` header in the form:

```
    Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>
```

### Properties

- bearerToken: (required) the bearer token value

### Programming example
```js
const { BearerTokenAuthenticator } = require('ibm-cloud-sdk-core');
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const bearerToken = // ... obtain bearer token value ...
const authenticator = new BearerTokenAuthenticator({
  bearerToken: bearerToken,
});

const options = {
  authenticator,
};

const service = new ExampleServiceV1(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
...
// Later, if your bearer token value expires, you can set a new one like this:
newToken = // ... obtain new bearer token value
authenticator.bearerToken = newToken;
```

### Configuration example
External configuration:
```
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_AUTH_TYPE=bearertoken
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_BEARER_TOKEN=<the bearer token value>
```
Application code:
```js
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const options = {
  serviceName: 'example_service',
};

const service = ExampleServiceV1.newInstance(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```

Note that the use of external configuration is not as useful with the `BearerTokenAuthenticator` as it
is for other authenticator types because bearer tokens typically need to be obtained and refreshed
programmatically since they normally have a relatively short lifespan before they expire. This
authenticator type is intended for situations in which the application will be managing the bearer
token itself in terms of initial acquisition and refreshing as needed.


## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Authentication (grant type: apikey)
The `IamAuthenticator` will accept a user-supplied apikey and will perform
the necessary interactions with the IAM token service to obtain a suitable
bearer token for the specified apikey. The authenticator will also obtain
a new bearer token when the current token expires. The bearer token is
then added to each outbound request in the `Authorization` header in the
form:
```
   Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>
```

### Properties

- apikey: (required) the IAM apikey to be used to obtain an IAM access token.

- url: (optional) The base endpoint URL of the IAM token service.
The default value of this property is the "prod" IAM token service endpoint
(`https://iam.cloud.ibm.com`).
Make sure that you use an IAM token service endpoint that is appropriate for the
location of the service being used by your application.
For example, if you are using an instance of a service in the "production" environment
(e.g. `https://resource-controller.cloud.ibm.com`),
then the default "prod" IAM token service endpoint should suffice.
However, if your application is using an instance of a service in the "staging" environment
(e.g. `https://resource-controller.test.cloud.ibm.com`),
then you would also need to configure the authenticator to use the IAM token service "staging"
endpoint as well (`https://iam.test.cloud.ibm.com`).

- clientId/clientSecret: (optional) The `clientId` and `clientSecret` fields are used to form a
"basic auth" Authorization header for interactions with the IAM token server. If neither field
is specified, then no Authorization header will be sent with token server requests. These fields
are optional, but must be specified together.

- scope: (optional) the scope to be associated with the IAM access token.
If not specified, then no scope wil be associated with the access token.

- disableSslVerification: (optional) A flag that indicates whether verification of the server's SSL
certificate should be disabled or not. The default value is `false`.

- headers: (optional) A set of key/value pairs that will be sent as HTTP headers in requests
made to the IAM token service.

### Programming example
```js
const { IamAuthenticator } = require('ibm-cloud-sdk-core');
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const authenticator = new IamAuthenticator({
  apikey: 'myapikey',
});

const options = {
  authenticator,
};

const service = new ExampleServiceV1(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```

### Configuration example
External configuration:
```
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_AUTH_TYPE=iam
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_APIKEY=myapikey
```
Application code:
```js
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const options = {
  serviceName: 'example_service',
};

const service = ExampleServiceV1.newInstance(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```


## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Authentication (grant type: assume)
The `IamAssumeAuthenticator` performs a two-step token fetch sequence to obtain
a bearer token that allows the application to assume the identity of a trusted profile:
1. First, the authenticator obtains an initial bearer token using grant type
`urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey`.
This initial token will reflect the identity associated with the input apikey.
2. Second, the authenticator uses the grant type `urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:assume` to obtain a bearer token
that reflects the identity of the trusted profile, passing in the initial bearer token
from the first step, along with the trusted profile-related inputs.

The authenticator will also obtain a new bearer token when the current token expires.
The bearer token is then added to each outbound request in the `Authorization` header in the
form:
```
   Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>
```

### Properties

- apikey: (required) the IAM apikey to be used to obtain the initial IAM access token.

- iamProfileCrn: (optional) the Cloud Resource Name (CRN) associated with the trusted profile
for which an access token should be fetched.
Exactly one of iamProfileCrn, iamProfileId or iamProfileName must be specified.

- iamProfileId: (optional) the ID associated with the trusted profile
for which an access token should be fetched.
Exactly one of iamProfileCrn, iamProfileId or iamProfileName must be specified.

- iamProfileName: (optional) the name associated with the trusted profile
for which an access token should be fetched. When specifying this property, you must also
specify the iamAccountId property as well.
Exactly one of iamProfileCrn, iamProfileId or iamProfileName must be specified.

- iamAccountId: (optional) the ID associated with the IAM account that contains the trusted profile
referenced by the iamProfileName property. The imaAccountId property must be specified if and only if
the iamProfileName property is specified.

- url: (optional) The base endpoint URL of the IAM token service.
The default value of this property is the "prod" IAM token service endpoint
(`https://iam.cloud.ibm.com`).
Make sure that you use an IAM token service endpoint that is appropriate for the
location of the service being used by your application.
For example, if you are using an instance of a service in the "production" environment
(e.g. `https://resource-controller.cloud.ibm.com`),
then the default "prod" IAM token service endpoint should suffice.
However, if your application is using an instance of a service in the "staging" environment
(e.g. `https://resource-controller.test.cloud.ibm.com`),
then you would also need to configure the authenticator to use the IAM token service "staging"
endpoint as well (`https://iam.test.cloud.ibm.com`).

- clientId/clientSecret: (optional) The `clientId` and `clientSecret` fields are used to form a
"basic auth" Authorization header for interactions with the IAM token server when fetching the
initial IAM access token. These fields are optional, but must be specified together.

- scope: (optional) the scope to be used when obtaining the initial IAM access token.
If not specified, then no scope will be associated with the access token.

- disableSslVerification: (optional) A flag that indicates whether verification of the server's SSL
certificate should be disabled or not. The default value is `false`.

- headers: (optional) A set of key/value pairs that will be sent as HTTP headers in requests
made to the IAM token service.

### Usage Notes
- The IamAssumeAuthenticator is used to obtain an access token (a bearer token) from the IAM token service
that allows an application to "assume" the identity of a trusted profile.

- The authenticator first uses the apikey, url, clientId/clientSecret, scope, disableSslVerification, and headers
properties to obtain an initial access token by invoking the IAM `getToken`
(grant_type=`urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey`) operation.

- The authenticator then uses the initial access token along with the url, iamProfileCrn, iamProfileId,
iamProfileName, iamAccountId, disableSSLVerification, and headers properties to obtain an access token by invoking
the IAM `getToken` (grant_type=`urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:assume`) operation.
The access token resulting from this second step will reflect the identity of the specified trusted profile.

- When providing the trusted profile information, you must specify exactly one of: iamProfileCrn, iamProfileId
or iamProfileName. If you specify iamProfileCrn or iamProfileId, then the trusted profile must exist in the same account that is
associated with the input apikey. If you specify iamProfileName, then you must also specify the iamAccountId property
to indicate the IAM account in which the named trusted profile can be found.

### Programming example
```js
const { IamAssumeAuthenticator } = require('ibm-cloud-sdk-core');
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

// Create the authenticator.
const authenticator = new IamAssumeAuthenticator({
  apikey: 'myapikey',
  iamProfileId: 'myprofile-1',
});

const options = {
  authenticator,
};

// Create the service instance.
const service = new ExampleServiceV1(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```

### Configuration example
External configuration:
```
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_AUTH_TYPE=iamAssume
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_APIKEY=myapikey
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_IAM_PROFILE_ID=myprofile-1
```
Application code:
```js
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const options = {
  serviceName: 'example_service',
};

const service = ExampleServiceV1.newInstance(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```


## Container Authentication
The `ContainerAuthenticator` is intended to be used by application code
running inside a compute resource managed by the IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS)
or IBM Cloud Code Engine in which a secure compute resource token (CR token)
has been stored in a file within the compute resource's local file system.
The CR token is similar to an IAM apikey except that it is managed automatically by
the compute resource provider (IKS or Code Engine).
This allows the application developer to:
- avoid storing credentials in application code, configuration files or a password vault
- avoid managing or rotating credentials

The `ContainerAuthenticator` will retrieve the CR token from
the compute resource in which the application is running, and will then perform
the necessary interactions with the IAM token service to obtain an IAM access token
using the IAM "get token" operation with grant-type `cr-token`.
The authenticator will repeat these steps to obtain a new IAM access token when the
current access token expires.
The IAM access token is added to each outbound request in the `Authorization` header in the form:
```
   Authorization: Bearer <IAM-access-token>
```

### Properties

- crTokenFilename: (optional) the name of the file containing the injected CR token value.
If not specified, then the authenticator will first try `/var/run/secrets/tokens/vault-token`
and then `/var/run/secrets/tokens/sa-token` and finally
`/var/run/secrets/codeengine.cloud.ibm.com/compute-resource-token/token` as the default value
(first file found is used).
The application must have `read` permissions on the file containing the CR token value.

- iamProfileName: (optional) the name of the linked trusted IAM profile to be used when obtaining the
IAM access token (a CR token might map to multiple IAM profiles).
One of `iamProfileName` or `iamProfileId` must be specified.

- iamProfileId: (optional) the id of the linked trusted IAM profile to be used when obtaining the
IAM access token (a CR token might map to multiple IAM profiles).
One of `iamProfileName` or `iamProfileId` must be specified.

- url: (optional) The base endpoint URL of the IAM token service.
The default value of this property is the "prod" IAM token service endpoint
(`https://iam.cloud.ibm.com`).
Make sure that you use an IAM token service endpoint that is appropriate for the
location of the service being used by your application.
For example, if you are using an instance of a service in the "production" environment
(e.g. `https://resource-controller.cloud.ibm.com`),
then the default "prod" IAM token service endpoint should suffice.
However, if your application is using an instance of a service in the "staging" environment
(e.g. `https://resource-controller.test.cloud.ibm.com`),
then you would also need to configure the authenticator to use the IAM token service "staging"
endpoint as well (`https://iam.test.cloud.ibm.com`).

- clientId/clientSecret: (optional) The `clientId` and `clientSecret` fields are used to form a
"basic auth" Authorization header for interactions with the IAM token service. If neither field
is specified, then no Authorization header will be sent with token server requests. These fields
are optional, but must be specified together.

- scope: (optional) the scope to be associated with the IAM access token.
If not specified, then no scope will be associated with the access token.

- disableSslVerification: (optional) A flag that indicates whether verification of the server's SSL
certificate should be disabled or not. The default value is `false`.

- headers: (optional) A set of key/value pairs that will be sent as HTTP headers in requests
made to the IAM token service.

- crTokenFilename: (optional) The name of the file containing the injected CR token value.
If not specified, then `/var/run/secrets/tokens/vault-token` is used as the default value.
The application must have `read` permissions on the file containing the CR token value.

### Programming example
```js
const { ContainerAuthenticator } = require('ibm-cloud-sdk-core');
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const authenticator = new ContainerAuthenticator({
  iamProfileName: 'iam-user123',
});

const options = {
  authenticator,
};

const service = new ExampleServiceV1(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```

### Configuration example
External configuration:
```
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_AUTH_TYPE=container
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_IAM_PROFILE_NAME=iam-user123
```
Application code:
```js
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const options = {
  serviceName: 'example_service',
};

const service = ExampleServiceV1.newInstance(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```


## VPC Instance Authentication
The `VpcInstanceAuthenticator` is intended to be used by application code
running inside a VPC-managed compute resource (virtual server instance) that has been configured
to use the "compute resource identity" feature.
The compute resource identity feature allows you to assign a trusted IAM profile to the compute resource as its "identity".
This, in turn, allows applications running within the compute resource to take on this identity when interacting with
IAM-secured IBM Cloud services.
This results in a simplified security model that allows the application developer to:
- avoid storing credentials in application code, configuration files or a password vault
- avoid managing or rotating credentials

The `VpcInstanceAuthenticator` will invoke the appropriate operations on the compute resource's locally-available
VPC Instance Metadata Service to (1) retrieve an instance identity token
and then (2) exchange that instance identity token for an IAM access token.
The authenticator will repeat these steps to obtain a new IAM access token whenever the current access token expires.
The IAM access token is added to each outbound request in the `Authorization` header in the form:
```
   Authorization: Bearer <IAM-access-token>
```

### Properties

- iamProfileCrn: (optional) the crn of the linked trusted IAM profile to be used when obtaining the IAM access token.

- iamProfileId: (optional) the id of the linked trusted IAM profile to be used when obtaining the IAM access token.

- url: (optional) The VPC Instance Metadata Service's base URL.
The default value of this property is `http://169.254.169.254`. However, if the VPC Instance Metadata Service is configured
with the HTTP Secure Protocol setting (`https`), then you should configure this property to be `https://api.metadata.cloud.ibm.com`.

Usage Notes:
1. At most one of `iamProfileCrn` or `iamProfileId` may be specified. The specified value must map
to a trusted IAM profile that has been linked to the compute resource (virtual server instance).

2. If both `iamProfileCrn` and `iamProfileId` are specified, then an error occurs.

3. If neither `iamProfileCrn` nor `iamProfileId` are specified, then the default trusted profile linked to the
compute resource will be used to perform the IAM token exchange.
If no default trusted profile is defined for the compute resource, then an error occurs.


### Programming example
```js
const { VpcInstanceAuthenticator } = require('ibm-cloud-sdk-core');
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const authenticator = new VpcInstanceAuthenticator({
  iamProfileCrn: 'crn:iam-profile-123',
});

const options = {
  authenticator,
};

const service = new ExampleServiceV1(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```

### Configuration example
External configuration:
```
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_AUTH_TYPE=vpc
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_IAM_PROFILE_CRN=crn:iam-profile-123
```
Application code:
```js
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const options = {
  serviceName: 'example_service',
};

const service = ExampleServiceV1.newInstance(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```


## Cloud Pak for Data Authentication
The `CloudPakForDataAuthenticator` will accept a user-supplied username value, along with either a
password or apikey, and will
perform the necessary interactions with the Cloud Pak for Data token service to obtain a suitable
bearer token. The authenticator will also obtain a new bearer token when the current token expires.
The bearer token is then added to each outbound request in the `Authorization` header in the
form:
```
   Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>
```
### Properties

- username: (required) the username used to obtain a bearer token.

- password: (required if apikey is not specified) the user's password used to obtain a bearer token.
Exactly one of password or apikey should be specified.

- apikey: (required if password is not specified) the user's apikey used to obtain a bearer token.
Exactly one of password or apikey should be specified.

- url: (required) The URL representing the Cloud Pak for Data token service endpoint's base URL string.
This value should not include the `/v1/authorize` path portion.

- disableSslVerification: (optional) A flag that indicates whether verification of the server's SSL
certificate should be disabled or not. The default value is `false`.

- headers: (optional) A set of key/value pairs that will be sent as HTTP headers in requests
made to the Cloud Pak for Data token service.

### Programming examples
```js
const { CloudPakForDataAuthenticator } = require('ibm-cloud-sdk-core');
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const authenticator = new CloudPakForDataAuthenticator({
  username: 'myuser',
  apikey: 'myapikey',
  url: 'https://mycp4dhost.com',
});

const options = {
  authenticator,
};

const service = new ExampleServiceV1(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```

### Configuration example

```
# Configure "example_service" with username/apikey.
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_AUTH_TYPE=cp4d
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_USERNAME=myuser
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_APIKEY=myapikey
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_URL=https://mycp4dhost.com
```
Application code:
```js
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const options = {
  serviceName: 'example_service',
};

const service = ExampleServiceV1.newInstance(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```


## Multi-Cloud Saas Platform (MCSP) V1 Authentication
The `McspAuthenticator` can be used in scenarios where an application needs to
interact with an IBM Cloud service that has been deployed to a non-IBM Cloud environment (e.g. AWS).
It accepts a user-supplied apikey and invokes the Multi-Cloud Saas Platform token service's
`POST /siusermgr/api/1.0/apikeys/token` operation to obtain a suitable MCSP access token (a bearer token)
for the specified apikey.
The authenticator will also obtain a new bearer token when the current token expires.
The bearer token is then added to each outbound request in the `Authorization` header in the
form:
```
   Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>
```

### Properties

- apikey: (required) the apikey to be used to obtain an MCSP access token.

- url: (required) The URL representing the MCSP token service endpoint's base URL string. Do not include the
operation path (e.g. `/siusermgr/api/1.0/apikeys/token`) as part of this property's value.

- disableSSLVerification: (optional) A flag that indicates whether verification of the server's SSL
certificate should be disabled or not. The default value is `false`.

- headers: (optional) A set of key/value pairs that will be sent as HTTP headers in requests
made to the MCSP token service.

### Usage Notes
- When constructing an McspAuthenticator instance, you must specify the apikey and url properties.

- The authenticator will use the token server's `POST /siusermgr/api/1.0/apikeys/token` operation to
exchange the user-supplied apikey for an MCSP access token (the bearer token).

### Programming example
```js
const { McspAuthenticator } = require('ibm-cloud-sdk-core');
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const authenticator = new McspAuthenticator({
  apikey: 'myapikey',
  url: 'https://example.mcsp.token-exchange.com',
});

const options = {
  authenticator,
};

const service = new ExampleServiceV1(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```

### Configuration example
External configuration:
```
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_AUTH_TYPE=mcsp
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_APIKEY=myapikey
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_AUTH_URL=https://example.mcsp.token-exchange.com
```
Application code:
```js
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const options = {
  serviceName: 'example_service',
};

const service = ExampleServiceV1.newInstance(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```


## Multi-Cloud Saas Platform (MCSP) V2 Authentication
The `McspV2Authenticator` can be used in scenarios where an application needs to
interact with an IBM Cloud service that has been deployed to a non-IBM Cloud environment (e.g. AWS).
It accepts a user-supplied apikey and invokes the Multi-Cloud Saas Platform token service's
`POST /api/2.0/{scopeCollectionType}/{scopeId}/apikeys/token` operation to obtain a suitable MCSP access token (a bearer token)
for the specified apikey.
The authenticator will also obtain a new bearer token when the current token expires.
The bearer token is then added to each outbound request in the `Authorization` header in the
form:
```
   Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>
```

### Properties

- apikey: (required) The apikey to be used to obtain an MCSP access token.

- url: (required) The URL representing the MCSP token service endpoint's base URL string. Do not include the
operation path (e.g. `/api/2.0/{scopeCollectionType}/{scopeId}/apikeys/token`) as part of this property's value.

- scopeCollectionType: (required) The scope collection type of item(s).
The valid values are: `accounts`, `subscriptions`, `services`.

- scopeId: (required) The scope identifier of item(s).

- includeBuiltinActions: (optional) A flag to include builtin actions in the `actions` claim in the MCSP token (default: false).

- includeCustomActions: (optional) A flag to include custom actions in the `actions` claim in the MCSP token (default: false).

- includeRoles: (optional) A flag to include the `roles` claim in the MCSP token (default: true).

- prefixRoles: (optional) A flag to add a prefix with the scope level where
the role is defined in the `roles` claim (default: false).

- callerExtClaim: (optional) A map containing keys and values to be injected into the returned access token
as the `callerExt` claim. The keys used in this map must be enabled in the apikey by setting the
`callerExtClaimNames` property when the apikey is created.
This property is typically only used in scenarios involving an apikey with identityType `SERVICEID`.

- disableSSLVerification: (optional) A flag that indicates whether verification of the server's SSL
certificate should be disabled or not. The default value is `false`.

- headers: (optional) A set of key/value pairs that will be sent as HTTP headers in requests
made to the MCSP token service.

### Usage Notes
- When constructing an McspV2Authenticator instance, the apikey, url, scopeCollectionType, and scopeId properties are required.

- If you specify the callerExtClaim map, the keys used in the map must have been previously enabled in the apikey
by setting the `callerExtClaimNames` property when you created the apikey.
The entries contained in this map will appear in the `callerExt` field (claim) of the returned access token.

- The authenticator will invoke the token server's `POST /api/2.0/{scopeCollectionType}/{scopeId}/apikeys/token` operation to
exchange the apikey for an MCSP access token (the bearer token).

### Programming example
```js
const { McspV2Authenticator } = require('ibm-cloud-sdk-core');
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const authenticator = new McspV2Authenticator({
  apikey: 'myapikey',
  url: 'https://example.mcsp.token-exchange.com',
  scopeCollectionType: 'accounts',
  scopeId: '20250519-2128-3755-60b3-103e01c509e8',
  includeBuiltinActions: true,
  callerExtClaim: {'productID': 'prod-123'},
});

const options = {
  authenticator,
};

const service = new ExampleServiceV1(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```

## No Auth Authentication
The `NoAuthAuthenticator` is a placeholder authenticator which performs no actual authentication function.
It can be used in situations where authentication needs to be bypassed, perhaps while developing
or debugging an application or service.

### Properties
None

### Programming example
```js
const { NoAuthAuthenticator } = require('ibm-cloud-sdk-core');
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const authenticator = new NoAuthAuthenticator();

const options = {
  authenticator,
};

const service = new ExampleServiceV1(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```

### Configuration example
External configuration:
```
export EXAMPLE_SERVICE_AUTH_TYPE=noauth
```
Application code:
```js
const ExampleServiceV1 = require('<sdk-package-name>/example-service/v1');

const options = {
  serviceName: 'example_service',
};

const service = ExampleServiceV1.newInstance(options);

// 'service' can now be used to invoke operations.
```
